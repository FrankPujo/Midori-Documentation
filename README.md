# Midori Documentation  
Midori Web Browser - a lightweight, fast and free web browser using WebKit and GTK+
This fork will provide a documentation for the Midori Browser  
Due to the constant update the documentation will have in the writing stage we suggest to look at the Midori offiial repository for complete information.  
This fork is not affiliated in any way with the Astian Group  

# How to use the Documentation  
To use the documenation download all the files in it and then open docs.html in your browser.  
# How to contribute  

Some guidelines for contribution are found in contribution.html and are accessible from the documentation itself.  
To contribute you can either fork the repo and pull a request or create an issue.
For contribution guidlines:
- use pull requests for bigger changes, like implementing a new page (definition: .html file) in the docs;
- use issues for smaller changes or signalation of mistakes;
- follow the template (found in template.html) and the writing style when writing html;
- for CSS elements stick with styles.css and add comments above to specify what it does (as it is currently in the file).  

Thank you very much!
